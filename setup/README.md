# Installations and Setup:
## VMs' Setup:
For the implementation of this project I used "~okeanos", a free-for-academic-purposes IAAS of GRNET (Greek Research & Technology Network). For the access and setup of the VMs, which include a private network and (optional) upgrades of their OS, we were given thorough instructions found in (enter: hyperlink)

The system is comprised of:
- 2 VMs:
  - _okeanos-master_ node: Role of Master and Slave node for Spark and role of Namenode and Datanode for HDFS
  - _okeanos-worker_ node: Role of Slave node for Spark and of Datanode for HDFS
- Private Network

## Installation and configuration of Apache Spark over YARN and of HDFS:
The steps followed for the installation of Apache Spark over Hadoop's resource manager, YARN, and of Hadoop's Distributed File System and for the configuration of the necessary environment variables can also be found in the instructions (enter: hyperlink) given.
